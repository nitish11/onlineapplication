In the present scenario,  IT is the key to digitalization of data processing and management. This offers us faster  updating, manipulation and interpretation of data and help extract some meaningful information  from it. This also enables proper utilization of resources and tracking of the current statistics.
Considering the current scenario of application system in our institute, form processing is still based on “paper and pen”  which is very obsolete and time taking for the students, faculties and other staffs of the institute and extracting information from this for future use or further reference is very difficult.
In this software, we are developing an online form processing system. In this system, there will be pre-filled data in the form which will save our precious time. This will also keep records of the data and maintain database and help interpret data using pie-charts and graphs.
